## Debugging

1. Even if it's seemed bad, often a `Printf` is quicked than a debugging tool
2. Logging data is *important*: a debug mode should always be available for medium to big programs.
3. `git-diff` is a good friend, that the first step to debugging

## Coding style

1. The style is often *subjective*. However, it matters to stay consistent.

1. Pencils and papers are your friends, feel free to fill a lot of them with notes, graphs or anything relevant: it frees your miond.
