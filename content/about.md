French computer scientist curious about everything, I've started this blog to centralise my knowledge and share some pieces of my mind with others if it can help. Everything written in this website is my opinion. It doesn't reflect the ideas of my employers, my family or anyone else.

As I like both languages, there might be some French and some English in this blog. Even if I'm not as confortable in English as in French, I will do my best to improve my writing style!

If you want to discuss with me, feel free to reach me. Below, see some links that could interest you:
